<h4>Webcam Archive Hints</h4>
<ul>
<li>Year, month, day and time can be selected separately, the other values remain.
<li>Grayed fields mean at this time there are no images. 
<li><b>Current</b> moves to latest image. 
<br>The image is automatically updated with the arrival of a new image (usually every 10 minutes). 
<li><b>Full size image</b>: 
A click on the image opens a large window with the full camera resolution.<br>
The section can be positioned by moving the mouse. <br>
The mouse wheel (or keys +/-) zooms the full size image.
<li>The archive is implemented with AJAX technology and therefore 
requires a modern browser with JavaScript enabled. </ul>

<h4>Image sequences as time lapse or thumbnail: </h4>
<table class="wchelptab">
<tr>
<td><img src="$webcamInclude/play.png"></td>
<td>Starts a time lapse sequence of the last pictures. 
<br>Date and time of the currently selected image is the basis, 
the time lapse plays up to this time. 
<br>The sequence is composed from the individual images, 
so this function works only with a fast computer and Internet access.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="$webcamInclude/play-d.png"></td>
<td>As above, but the sequence is formed over several days for each of the same time. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="$webcamInclude/thumb.png"></td>
<td>Shows a series of thumbnails. 
<br>The presentation begins with the most recent (or previously selected) image 
and is reverse chronological. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="$webcamInclude/thumb-d.png"></td>
<td>As above, but the sequence is formed over several days for each of the same time.
